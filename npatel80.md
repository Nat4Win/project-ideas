  ## Project Summary
  The idea behind the project is to revamp NASA's exoplanet archive webpages so that a normal user would have an easier time navigating and finding what it is they are looking for. Currently all the planets are not in one place, but rather in multiple different location making it hard to find something if you go to the wrong link. And so, to make it a more inviting experience, there would be a central webpage that can search through all the sites and draw forth the information that is pertinent to the user's query.
  ## Problem Solving
  The central webpage would become an easier way to sift through all the overwhelming information so that an average person just interested in the data would have a enjoyable time browsing. It would also save time when people are trying to compare and search for data across multiple webpages.
  ## Major Features
  * Centralized search (One search thing for all the sites)
  * Limited, Advanced, and Old Search
    * Limited - select options for search parameters and receive results
    * Advanced - plug in all or as many search parameters when user knows what they are looking for
    * Old - Send them to the old webpages to do as they please
  * Related/Most Likely search result (Try to extrapolate from inputs and find most likely result)
  ## Needed Languages
  * Webdesign (HTLM, CSS, Java, etc.)
  * C++ or Python (Depends on what the output comes out as from the api)
  ## Intended Buyer
  It would be a replacement for NASA's old webpages
