# Assignment 2

The goal of this assignment is to generate project ideas. Write a proposal for a project that might be used as your class group project. Write it as if you are pitching the idea to your company using an informal method like the phase 0 documents we talked about in class. Note that not all project ideas will become class projects just like not all project proposals in a company will be developed as products.

The proposal should be about 1/2 page â€“ 1 page in length and include:

- brief summary of the project idea
- what problem is being solved
- list of some of the major features
- what languages, tool sets, third-party code, etc you plan to use
- who would buy/use this solution

Submit the assignment by adding your proposal to the github repository https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/project-ideas/ in a file named by your netid. The file should be in either .md format or pdf format. Push this file directly the the repository rather than using a pull request. The following steps show how to push directly to the repository:
1. git clone git@github.com:utk-cs340-spring22/project-ideas.git
2. git add netid.md (replace netid with your actual netid)
3. git commit -m "initial commit" netid.md
4. git push
