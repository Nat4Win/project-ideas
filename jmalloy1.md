# [YED](https://github.com/your-editor/yed) LSP Plugin
I Recently have started using a text editor that is written by a grad student in the lab I work in called [YED](https://github.com/your-editor/yed). [YED](https://github.com/your-editor/yed) is very expandable using its plugin system, and Microsoft has developed a protocol called the language server protocol which is designed to allow people to make one language server that will work with multiple text editors if those text editors have implemented a language server protocol client. I would like to implement a plugin for [YED](https://github.com/your-editor/yed) to implement the language server protocol client so that it can interface with language servers. [YED](https://github.com/your-editor/yed) and most of its plugins are written in C, but theoretically any language that can produce a shared object file in a C ABI and can call C functions would work. This would mean that Rust or Go should work fine, but the simplest choices would be either C or C++, and since the LSP (language server protocol) makes extensive use of json, I think that C would probably be painful to use without the STL. This project would be cool because if it was made and works well, it would be used by my coworkers, myself and almost anyone else who uses [YED](https://github.com/your-editor/yed), so it has some real-world use, but the downside would be that it will be difficult to implement and especially in a single semester. We would have to accept that we would be implementing a subset of LSP and only certain features. The project would probably continue to be maintained beyond the scope of the class since it could end up being such an important plugin for [YED](https://github.com/your-editor/yed) if implemented well. This project may not be conducive to a one semester class, because of its size, and because it would have to become an opensource continued project afterwards, but it would be interesting to start a project that may have actual continued use and development beyond the end of the class.
