One of my and my best friend's favorite passtimes is looking through Google reviews of
local businesses and restaurants to find people that are either irrationally angry or
have very little grasp on proper grammar (there is often a lot of overlap in these two 
categories). This passtime has made us wonder if there was an easier way to conglomerate
the kind of content we look for. 

My project idea is a website that would act as a webscraper that takes in and analyzes 
all of the Google reviews on a user-provided business to find and create different sub-
categories of reviews, such as the most angry (judging by things such as the most amount
of all capital letter words and profanity used), the most misspelled (judging by the 
number of words that a computer wouldn't be able to recognize), etc. This idea could 
also be expanded to include more subcategories and avenues for reviews, such as Amazon 
reviews of specific products, Yelp, etc. 

This would make finding these funny reviews much easier than scrolling through every
negative review left on a business's page, which are often disappointingly riddled with legitimate complaints and experiences with the business that contain no comedic value. 

This could be implemented using web development languages such html, as well as Python
functionalities to be able to search for and analyze content through different web API
packages. 

This project would be mainly for entertainment purposes for people who are curious 
to find out just how derranged the general public is towards their local establishments.
It could also be used for YouTube content creators who specialize in doing dramatic 
readings of absurd reviews to more easily find and sort the content they use for videos.
