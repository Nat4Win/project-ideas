# Pierluigi Cambie-Fabris
  ## Summary
  This project intends to provide a more user-friendly and accessible version of what is currently NASA's exoplanet archives. As it is now, NASA's archives are functionally multiple excel spreadsheets in different locations with a list of planets and various associated values such as distance. The way these archives are set up make them very difficult to use for anyone who is not very familiar with the field. This project plans to make the archives easier to search from one location with additional useful functions such as an advanced search and guided search.
  ## Problem
  The problem at hand is that the NASA exoplanet archives are difficult to use for normal users who might want to use them. This project intends to address this by making information from all archives easily accessible and adding different search functions.
  ## Features
  * Making all archives searchable from one location
  * Simple search
    * Allows user to search keywords
  * Advanced search
    * Allows user to set various planetary values as search parameters
  * Guided search
    * Presents user with options to narrow down search and suggestions based on input
  ## Languages
  * Likely Python
  * HTML, CSS, Java (general webpage development, not all three are necessary)
  ## Buyer
  This project would serve to improve NASA's webpage, so NASA would be the buyer. Users would be anyone that is intending to search for planets using the exoplanet archives.
